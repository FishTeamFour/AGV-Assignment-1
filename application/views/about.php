    <h1>About</h1>
    <p id="aboutp">This website is an assignment for our COMP 4711 class at BCIT. The goal 
    of this assignment is to create a catalog of items for a person or thing. 
    The items should have attributes that affect the target's attributes. The 
    main theme of this assignment is <b>Accessorizing</b>.</p>
    <p id="aboutp">Our team decided on the topic of video game equipment, more specifically the 
    equipment from Albion Online. We chose to focus on five pieces of equipment: 
    Headgear, Weapons, Armor, Offhand, and Footwear. Each item has three attributes:
    Health, Attack, and Defense.</p>
    <p id="aboutp">To choose equipment: select one of the item slots then select 
    the equipment that you want to equip.</p>
